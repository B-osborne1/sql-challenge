##Precursor, all information within this repo are fictional and not based on real identities

This repo involves the use of SQL to identify and analyse workers from the fictional company 'Pewlett Hackard' between the years of 1980 and 1999. This is inclusive of factors such as name, hire-date, salary and departments.

The repo is split into three sections:

1) data: Contains the raw data split over six csv files

2) Employee data ERD: Gives an overview of the relationship between each of the six data sources. Contains both the code to recreate the table and an exported image of the final result. 
The ERD was created at the following address: https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

3) Employee SQL code: Provides the codes to analyse the data and is broken into two distinct sections
Step one- table codes: This is heavily based on the exported ERD code developed in section 2, however, foreign keys have been added into the table creation for ease and cleanliness of code. This code will allow you to import the csv files, but note that this will need to be in the order the tables appear in the code
Step two- After importing csvs, this code will allow for eight different analysis' to take place. Each has been labeled to identify which properties are being sought after
